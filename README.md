# AlphaBetaLabs

## What This Repo Is
- An authority-ordered corpus for building AlphaBetaLabs systems: Governance -> Canon -> Enforcement -> Manifest -> Engines/Plugins/Systems -> Research -> Experiments -> Archive.

## What This Repo Is NOT
- Not an implementation-first codebase.
- Not a place to redefine Canon from below.
- Not a dumping ground for temporary structures.

## Identity And Immutability (Locked)
- `AlphaBeta Labs` (the lab/creator/brand) is mutable: humans and research evolve.
- Immutability starts at the artifact boundary: engine constitutions (per version), frozen semantic manifests, and signed canonical outputs.
- Drift is allowed in research and mirrors/bridges; drift is forbidden inside a released engine constitution version (changes require a new version via governance).
- `AlphaBetaLabs.io` is a distribution surface for stabilized engines/products (outside this repo’s authority layers).

## Authority Flow (highest to lowest)
1. `00_GOVERNANCE/` (who decides, how)
2. `01_CANON/` (engine law / immutable per version)
3. `02_ENFORCEMENT/` (law -> obligation; refusal semantics)
4. `03_MANIFEST/` (intent as data; unit of determinism)
5. `04_ENGINES/` (engines prove compliance upward)
6. `05_PLUGINS/` (adapters; no engine logic)
7. `06_SYSTEMS/` (cross-cutting runtimes; cannot override Canon)
8. `07_RESEARCH/` (lineage and direction; informs only)
9. `08_EXPERIMENTS/` (unsafe zone; graduates upward only via amendment)
10. `09_ARCHIVE/` (history without authority)

## Where To Start Reading
1. `01_CANON/ENGINE_CONSTITUTION.md`
2. `02_ENFORCEMENT/ENFORCEMENT_MAP.md`
3. `07_RESEARCH/00_PRIMARY/PAPERS/`
4. `07_RESEARCH/10_MIRRORS/COMPARATIVE_ANALYSIS/Foundation_Mirror_Policy.md`
